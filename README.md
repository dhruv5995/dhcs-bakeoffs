# Designing Human-Centered Software

This repository contains the source to my groups' bakeoffs for 05-391 Designing
Human-Centered Software. The course was taught using "Bakeoffs." For each
Bakeoff, we were given a design objective and a set of constraints to design
within. A winner was selected after testing the designs in class, round-robin
style.

## Group 1

Members: Wendy Chou, Skylar Weaver, Peter Weon, and Jake Zimmerman

### 1: Target Clicking

Given a 4x4 grid of squares, attempt to repeatedly select the target square as
quickly as possible.

### 2: Text Entry

Given a 1" square patch of a smart phone touch screen (meant to simulate a
touch-enabled watch), design a system that allows the user to enter a target
phrase as quickly as possible (voice recognition explicitly disallowed).

## Group 2

Members: Hanna Ha, Sophie Vennex, Randy Yu, and Jake Zimmerman

### 3: Center, Resize, & Rotate

Given a target square of a certain size, orientation, and position, as well as
a source square with random measurements, manipulate the source square to match
the target square to within some threshold.

### 4: Sensors

Without touching the screen, users needed to select one of four targets, and
having locked in their selection needed to perform one of 2 actions. Target
selection as well as performing an action was to be done strictly using the
phone's sensors (accelerometer, compass, microphone, etc.) excluding the touch
screen.
